Hello, I am @cmarangu on github,
this was a "project" *scoffs* I started in 2015
I am writing this in 2018

I followed AppleProgramming's tutorial at the following Uniform Resource Locator:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQNuixO0tQU

I implemented some stuff I found about NSBezierPath BezierPathWithEllipseInRect and also keyboard which I found out on stackoverflow and on the same site, but which was my original idea, to implement keyboard control in the screensaver, because old screensavers like word of the day press 'D' key to read about it
but I wanted full on keyboard control
but I still let you shake mouse to exit screensaver

here's the link on nsbezierpath:actually I can't find it on google or browser history ;(

Then I added a bunch of messy random stuff for fun and for learning: a enum, a macro or 2, a C struct, and also each serves its own unique purpose. In making the screensaver function.

You will need a mac with 10.9.5 (or probably 10.13.0 now since I updated xcode) or later. open the Ping.saver file to install it. Or don't. I will not blackmail u. Be warned, uninstalling is hard or impossible as u wil have to go to Users>yourself>Library>Screen Savers or Macintosh>System>Library>Screen Savers to even find it, open context menu (right click), and click Move To Trash, and since it's in a strange place it will ask u to enter your login password. Trust me, it's not a virus; it's a .saver file.

Hello, I am @cmarangu.
This is my attempt at a README file for the Ping.saver Pong screensaver for Mac OS 10.9.5 I composed in Apple, Inc.'s Xcode 6.1.1.
Enjoy! if you have a Mac with OS 10.9.5
